Hello

This project was build watching a class of Wes Bos, JavaScript 30 course.
Using Vanilla JS and CSS.
I kept the idea of css "analog clock", saw how he did to create the shape and how he got the seconds. Then I made the rest of the structure, created the digital clock and fixed a little bug of the transition pointer function.
